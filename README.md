## :page_facing_up: Description

- Movie Media Mania is your go to source for searching, learning, reviewing, and sharing information on all your favorite movies!
- This repo showcases a completed front-end and back-end project.

### Motivation
Our motivation for creating this application was in part due to the Oscars this past weekend. Some of us had seen many of the pictures nominated, but we couldnâ€™t remember the list of all the movies we watched. It was also hard to recall details of some of the movies, as we watched them months ago. We were joking about getting on IMDB or Letterboxd to prevent this in the future, and then realized we could fix the problem with our project.

### User Story
- AS A person who likes to watch movies
- I WANT have a social media website for movies where I can search movies and write reviews on them
- SO THAT I can have a place for the movies I have seen and my reviews on these movies.
